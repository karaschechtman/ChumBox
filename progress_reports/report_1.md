# February 24, 2019

Note: Shaine and I did not realize that progress reports should be completed separately, so we worked on this one together. Professor Schulzrinne told us it was fine to submit the same one for this week, but that in the future we should work on them separately (which we will).

# Progress Report #1

## Status light

Yellow - we met our week 2 milestones, but did not end up accomplishing all of week 1 while waiting for the proposals. We should be able to catch up to our milestones (revised a bitâ€”see Problems) over the course of the next week. 

## Plans

### Week 1

- Both: Do in-depth research on Taboola and advertising models.

### Week 2

- Kara: Create scraper that, given the input of an individual website, outlines the name of the articles in the Taboola box for that website
- Shaine: Sign up for a Taboola account and take notes on the process; experiment on embedding the Taboola box into various different websites

## Progress

### Week 1

- Both: Created a list of sources to read and began reading them.
- Both: Created project tracking tools & GitHub.
- Both: Took typing speed test to determine who should be official typist. Kara won with 96 WPM, 100% accuracy, while Shaine lost with a respectable 56 WPM 96% accuracy.

### Week 2

- Kara: checked scraper code into GitHub on 2/22
- Shaine: Created Taboola account, explored the process of creating a Taboola ad and putting a Taboola box on a website (see problems)

## Coming Up

- Shaine: write script to detect Taboola boxes around the web
- Kara: create database of lots of Taboola ads
- Both: continue research

## Problems

On reflection, we have realized we probably underestimated how much time reading would take us, especially for broader content on general advertisement models, so we've revised our plan to do a bulk of reading in the beginning, still, but will continue to read over the course of the semester as necessary.

In order to embed a Taboola box on a website we need to get approved by Taboola, which involves having a website to put that box on that Taboola would approve. 

In order to create a Taboola ad we need somewhere around $50 to publish it, so we need to figure out if we can get that money somehow. 

## Coordination and cooperation

We met several times this week to go over our progress and to work together. We collaborated to create reading lists to ensure that we weren't reading the same sources.
